        <h1>30 DAY WISE PLAN FOR LEARNING C LANGUAGE</h1><hr><hr><hr>
        
        <p1>Learning a programming language like C requires a structured and consistent approach. Here's a suggested 30-day plan to help you learn C:</p1>
        <ol>
        DAYS 1-5: BASICS OF C
        
        <li>Days 1-2:</li>
         <ul> Understand the basics, history, and purpose of C. Set up your development environment.</ul>
        <li>Days 3-5:</li>
         <ul>Learn about variables, data types, and basic input/output operations. Write simple programs to practice.</ul>
        DAYS 6-10:CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS
        <li>Days 6-8: </li>
         <ul>Study decision-making structures like if-else statements. Practice with different conditional statements.</ul>
        <li>Days 9-10:</li>
         <ul>Learn loops (for, while, do-while) and practice using them in various scenarios.</ul>
        DAYS 11-15:FUNCTIONS AND MODULAR PROGRAMMING
        <li>Days 11-12:</li> 
         <ul>Understand the concept of functions. Write functions and learn about scope and lifetime of variables.</ul>
        <li>Days 13-15:</li>
         <ul>Practice modular programming. Break down your programs into functions for better code organization.</ul>
        DAYS 16-20: ARRAYS AND STRINGS
        <li>Days 16-18:</li>
         <ul>Study arrays and multidimensional arrays. Practice with different array operations.</ul>
        <li>Days 19-20:</li>
         <ul>Learn about strings in C. Understand string manipulation functions.</ul>
        DAYS 21-25:POINTERS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
        <li>Days 21-22:</li>
         <ul>Explore the concept of pointers. Learn about pointer arithmetic and address manipulation.</ul>
        <li>Days 23-25:</li>
         <ul>Study dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free). Understand how to work with dynamic memory.</ul>
        DAYS 26-28: FILE HANDLING
        <li>Days 26-27:</li>
         <ul>Learn about file input/output operations in C.</ul>
        <li>Day 28:</li>
         <ul>Practice reading from and writing to files. Understand file handling concepts.</ul>
        DAYS 29-30: FINAL PROJECTS AND REVIEW
        <li>Day 29:</li>
         <ul>Work on small projects to apply your knowledge. Practice solving problems on coding platforms.</ul>
        <li>Day 30:</li>
         <ul>Review the entire C language. Focus on areas where you feel less confident. Complete any remaining exercises or projects.</ul>
        Remember to practice regularly, engage with the C community, and seek help when needed. Adjust the plan based on your progress and interests. Happy coding!
